RERSS
*****

ReRSS is a simple Django/Google App Engine application meant to re-syndicate
RSS feeds in a post-Google Reader world. It maintains a list of feed URLs,
downloads them on a regular basis, and re-syndicates the contents, preventing
items from aging off before they can be read. It's meant to be used with
stand-alone (i.e., non-synching) desktop RSS Readers.

Requirements
============

ReRSS runs on Google App Engine.
